Contributing:

If you wish to contribute please follow these general guidelines:

Use tabs in code. 

Methods should have opening bracket on same line as method decleration. 

No IClassname, instead use something similar to BaseClassName or something else.

Names should be SpecificGeneral. So for example PlayerEntity, PineappleItem, or ServerObject.

Please run the game on both client and server once to make sure the imolentation actually works and doesn't just compile.
